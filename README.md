# URL Text Actions - Alfred workflow

This workflow provides actions for getting text from the browser or a URL.

From the frontmost browser tab or with a URL selected, get the page text as markdown, a markdown link, and more. Paste it automatically with a keyword and modifier, a Snippet Trigger, or a Universal Action.

## Setup

Install Brett Terpstra's [Gather CLI](https://brettterpstra.com/projects/gather-cli/) service, which is required for the actions that get the page text or title from the web.

## Usage

Copy the front browser page text as markdown via the `bpmd` keyword.
